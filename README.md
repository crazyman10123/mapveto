# mapveto
This is the mapveto system that was used by CCS in seasons 1 to 3. I wrote this very quickly to address something that was needed by the team.
If you are going to use this at all, you need to make major security modifications. When this was in use, everything was kept private and the web server was only on when it was being used by CCS staff.
I do not plan on updating this at all unless there becomes major interest in it.
